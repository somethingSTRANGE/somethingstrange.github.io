[{"content":"Font Awesome is an icon font. It\u0026rsquo;s used all over the place. I use it when developing editor tools for my Unity projects. I love it. It\u0026rsquo;s awesome.\nI just started working on this site and I chose to build it with Hugo, which is a very popular open-source static site generator. So far, I like it a lot, but I was keenly interested in adding support for Font Awesome.\nThe Font Awesome docs provide numerous ways to get started, from kits to self-hosted setups, and using web fonts or SVG images with javascript. There are many, many articles that detail the advantages of SVG icons over font icons, so I\u0026rsquo;m only interested in utilizing SVGs.\nThe traditional setup involves loading in a JavaScript files on every page that will includes icons, and then using placeholder tags wherever you want icons to appear. JavaScript will replace those tags with SVGs once everything finishes loading.\nA 2018 article by Nick Glabreath mentions some potential downsides to the traditional setup, such as extra network dependencies and potential processing delays. It also provides some great information on embedding SVGs directly in the page when the site is built, which avoids the extra network calls and delays at the expense of a slightly larger page load.\nA more recent article by Micah R Ledbetter took what Galbreath presented and made a few enhancements, which I will build upon further.\nQuick and Easy Download Font Awesome I have an active subscription to Font Awesome Pro, so I just downloaded the v5.15.4 release from their website, but you can download the latest release or the free icon set from the GitHub repository. The version I\u0026rsquo;m using contains 7,864 pro icons and 1,608 free icons.\nCopy the SVGs Some of the other articles have you place the SVG (scalable vector graphics) files inside your theme folder, however Hugo is designed for customization with a layer-like site generation workflow. This allows you to modify your site and override your theme without actually changing the theme code or folder structure. Here\u0026rsquo;s a short post illustrating how Hugo Theme Layering works. Ideally nothing should be changed inside the theme folder, and that includes adding your Font Awesome SVGs. So they\u0026rsquo;ll be added to the root instead.\nThe SVGs were extracted from the archive and placed in the assets folder, since they\u0026rsquo;re used like other assets and only accessed when the site is built. The hierarchy looks like this:\n \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;\nassets\nsvg\nbrands\nduotone\nlight\nregular\nsolid\n If you\u0026rsquo;re using the free version of Font Awesome, you may only have a few of those folders, such as solid and brands.\nAdd the partials Processing the SVG Create a partial file: \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;/layouts/partials/fontawesome.html\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  {{- $settings := partial \u0026#34;func/getFontAwesomeSettings.html\u0026#34; (dict \u0026#34;style\u0026#34; .style \u0026#34;arg1\u0026#34; .arg1 \u0026#34;arg2\u0026#34; .arg2) -}} \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;line-height:1em; vertical-align:middle;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {{- $fname:=print \u0026#34;/assets/svg/\u0026#34; .style \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; .icon \u0026#34;.svg\u0026#34; -}} {{- if (fileExists $fname) -}} {{- $svg := readFile $fname -}} {{- $svg = replace $svg \u0026#34; 512\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--\u0026#34; (print \u0026#34; 512\\\u0026#34; style=\\\u0026#34;height:\u0026#34; $settings.size \u0026#34;; width:\u0026#34; $settings.size \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--\u0026#34;) -}} {{- $svg = replaceRE \u0026#34;\u0026lt;!--[^\u0026gt;]*--\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \u0026#34;\u0026#34; $svg -}} {{- if eq .style \u0026#34;duotone\u0026#34; -}} {{- $svg = replace $svg \u0026#34;class=\\\u0026#34;fa-primary\\\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;\u0026#34; (print \u0026#34;class=\\\u0026#34;fa-primary\\\u0026#34; style=\\\u0026#34;fill:\u0026#34; $settings.primaryColor \u0026#34;; opacity:\u0026#34; $settings.primaryOpacity \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) -}} {{- $svg = replace $svg \u0026#34;class=\\\u0026#34;fa-secondary\\\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;\u0026#34; (print \u0026#34;class=\\\u0026#34;fa-secondary\\\u0026#34; style=\\\u0026#34;fill:\u0026#34; $settings.secondaryColor \u0026#34;; opacity:\u0026#34; $settings.secondaryOpacity \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) -}} {{- $svg = replace $svg \u0026#34;\u0026lt;defs\u0026gt;\u0026lt;style\u0026gt;.fa-secondary{opacity:.4}\u0026lt;/style\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/defs\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \u0026#34;\u0026#34; -}} {{- else -}} {{- $svg = replace $svg \u0026#34;\u0026lt;path\u0026#34; (print \u0026#34;\u0026lt;path fill=\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34; $settings.primaryColor \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34; opacity=\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34; $settings.primaryOpacity \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) -}} {{- end -}} {{- $svg | safeHTML -}} {{- else -}} \u0026lt;span class=\u0026#34;sc-fontawesome-missing\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Could not find \u0026amp;quot;{{.icon}}\u0026amp;quot; icon with \u0026amp;quot;{{.style}}\u0026amp;quot; style\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;#xFFFD;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {{- warnf \u0026#34;Could not find \\\u0026#34;%s\\\u0026#34; icon with \\\u0026#34;%s\\\u0026#34; style.\u0026#34; .icon .style -}} {{- end -}} \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{{- \u0026#34;\u0026#34; -}}   Note that this partial differs from Ledbetter\u0026rsquo;s in a few ways.\n This partial was placed outside the theme, so the theme folder path is no longer needed in the $fname variable. The icon style and name are passed to the partial separately and accessed using .style and .icon, respectively. Optional size and color (with opacity) settings may now be passed through the shortcodes, and the input is validated with a call to the getFontAwesomeSettings partial, which returns values that are accessed with $settings. The size is applied directly to \u0026lt;svg\u0026gt; using inline styles, which seems to improve layout and sizing with adjacent text. There\u0026rsquo;s now special handling of duotone icons, which have primary and secondary colors and opacities, and those need to be applied to the appropriate \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; in the SVG. The \u0026lt;defs\u0026gt;\u0026lt;style\u0026gt; combo is also removed, as its no longer needed. There\u0026rsquo;s a check to see if the file exists before rendering it. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, a build warning will be logged and the replacement glyph (�) will be embedded into the page instead. The span wrapping the replacement character also has a tooltip that includes the icon and style names being used, which may be useful for debugging the missing icon. Most importantly, this check allows Hugo to successfully rebuild the page, otherwise the build will fail when readFile fails to load the missing SVG file.  Parsing Settings Create a partial file: \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;/layouts/partials/func/getFontAwesomeSettings.html\nNote that I placed this in the func sub-directory, because this partial will return a value, and I like to keep partials that return values separate from those that don\u0026rsquo;t.\nA partial that returns a value may only return a value and cannot affect rendering output, so there\u0026rsquo;s no need to worry about whitespace sneaking into the generated HTML when the site is built. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30  {{ $lengthPattern := \u0026#34;^[\\\\d\\\\.]+(?i)(?:cm|in|mm|pc|pt|px|q|%|ch|em|ex|lh|rem|vh|vmax|vmin|vw)(?-i)$\u0026#34; }} {{ $data := newScratch }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;size\u0026#34; \u0026#34;1em\u0026#34; }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;primaryColor\u0026#34; \u0026#34;currentColor\u0026#34; }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;primaryOpacity\u0026#34; \u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;secondaryColor\u0026#34; \u0026#34;currentColor\u0026#34; }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;secondaryOpacity\u0026#34; \u0026#34;0.4\u0026#34; }} {{ $args := slice .arg1 .arg2 }} {{ range $args }} {{ $length := findRE $lengthPattern . }} {{ with $length }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;size\u0026#34; (delimit $length \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) }} {{ else }} {{ with . }} {{ $parts := split . \u0026#34;;\u0026#34; }} {{ with (index $parts 0) }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;primaryColor\u0026#34; ((partial \u0026#34;func/getFontAwesomeColorOpacity.html\u0026#34; (slice . 0)) | default \u0026#34;currentColor\u0026#34;) -}}) }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;primaryOpacity\u0026#34; ((partial \u0026#34;func/getFontAwesomeColorOpacity.html\u0026#34; (slice . 1)) | default \u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;) -}}) }} {{ end }} {{ with (index $parts 1) }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;secondaryColor\u0026#34; ((partial \u0026#34;func/getFontAwesomeColorOpacity.html\u0026#34; (slice . 0)) | default \u0026#34;currentColor\u0026#34;) -}}) }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;secondaryOpacity\u0026#34; ((partial \u0026#34;func/getFontAwesomeColorOpacity.html\u0026#34; (slice . 1)) | default \u0026#34;0.4\u0026#34;) -}}) }} {{ end }} {{ end }} {{ end }} {{ end }} {{- return (dict \u0026#34;size\u0026#34; ($data.Get \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;) \u0026#34;primaryColor\u0026#34; ($data.Get \u0026#34;primaryColor\u0026#34;) \u0026#34;primaryOpacity\u0026#34; ($data.Get \u0026#34;primaryOpacity\u0026#34;) \u0026#34;secondaryColor\u0026#34; ($data.Get \u0026#34;secondaryColor\u0026#34;) \u0026#34;secondaryOpacity\u0026#34; ($data.Get \u0026#34;secondaryOpacity\u0026#34;) ) -}}   This may look a bit complicated, but that\u0026rsquo;s because either or both of the size and color/opacity settings can be provided and in any order, which simplifies the shortcode usage and makes it more flexible. Also, the color data is a compound string containing up to two color and two opacity values, which are parsed and separated before the values are returned.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll run through it quickly.\n A regex pattern is used to identify the size argument, and all length types defined in the CSS specification are included. I only tested with em, rem, and px, but they should all work as expected. A scratch is used to store potential results as the partial arguments are being processed. Default values are established and will be used unless the setting is overridden by an argument. Both arguments are examined, and if the size is identified, it\u0026rsquo;s used, otherwise color parsing is performed. Parsing calls the getFontAwesomeColorOpacity partial, which takes a slice and returns a string, and if parsing fails a default value will be applied. The results are returned in a dict using named parameters.  Parsing Color and Opacity Create a partial file: \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;/layouts/partials/func/getFontAwesomeColorOpacity.html\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7  {{ $result := 0 }} {{ $parts := split (index . 0) \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; }} {{ with (index $parts (index . 1)) }} {{ $result = trim . \u0026#34; \\t\\n\u0026#34; }} {{ end }} {{- return $result -}}   This partial is really simple. It takes a slice containing a string and an index. The string may contain both color and opacity data, so it\u0026rsquo;s split into color and opacity. The index just tells the function which setting is requested, and if it exists, it\u0026rsquo;ll be returned, otherwise the function will return 0 as an failure condition.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it! On to the shortcodes!\nAdd the shortcodes For each shortcode you want to use, create a file at: \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;/layouts/shortcodes/. I created a shortcode for each of the Font Awesome styles (brands, duotone, light, regular, solid).

Unfortunately, most of those resources focus on setting up Verdaccio on a local system, and when docker is involved the tutorials usually assume docker is being run from the command line.\nRunning docker containers on a Synology NAS is a completely different process, and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to find even a single resource that covered the procedure. This post will hopefully clear some things up.\nDocker  First things first, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to install the Docker package if it\u0026rsquo;s not already installed.\nDocker is a lightweight virtualization application that gives you the ability to run thousands of containers created by developers from all over the world on DSM. The hugely popular built-in image repository, Docker Hub, allows you to find shared applications from other talented developers.\n— Synology DSM Feature: Docker   Open Synology Package Center.\n  Search for docker, select it, and click Install.\n   Folder Setup  When working with Docker containers, I try to handle them like read-only objects whenever possible. If the container needs to work with persistent data, that data should be stored outside the container.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s common for containers to provide \u0026ldquo;mount paths\u0026rdquo; that can be used to map file system folders to the container. The container will then store data in those mapped folders. Later, if you decide to update or replace the container, the persistent data will remain in these folders.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t store data in containers - A container can be stopped, destroyed, or replaced. An application version 1.0 running in container should be easily replaced by the version 1.1 without any impact or loss of data. For that reason, if you need to store data, do it in a volume. In this case, you should also take care if two containers write data on the same volume as it could cause corruption. Make sure your applications are designed to write to a shared data store.\n— 10 things to avoid in docker containers, #1 Tip The Verdaccio container exposes three mount paths (conf, plugins, and storage), and we\u0026rsquo;re going to set those folders up first, so that they\u0026rsquo;re ready to use when Verdaccio is configured later.\n Create a Shared Folder called docker. It\u0026rsquo;s assumed you\u0026rsquo;ve already created shared folders on your NAS and know how it\u0026rsquo;s done.\nConsider using the following configuration options:\n Disable: Advanced Permissions, Recycle Bin, and File Compression. Enable: Data Integrity Protection.    Using File Station, create the following folder hierarchy, which will be used by the container:\n docker  verdaccio  conf  plugins  storage    Download Verdaccio  Download the latest 5.x container, which as of 2022-03-01 is 5.6.2.\nVersion 6 (Development branch)\n— GitHub / Verdaccio  Open Docker and go to the Registry tab.\n  Search for verdaccio/verdaccio, select it, and click Download.\n  Select 5 from the Please Choose a Tag dropdown and click Select.\n   Install Verdaccio   In Docker, go to the Image tab.\n  Launch verdaccio/verdaccio:5 image with the following settings:\n Change the Container Name name, as desired. The default name is verdaccio-verdaccio. Check Enable resource limitation, if you want to control how much memory the container will use. My NAS has 8 GB of RAM, so I set the Memory Limit to 2048 MB.\n    Click Advanced Settings and go to the Advanced Settings tab, if it\u0026rsquo;s not already selected.\n Check Enable auto-restart so that the container will restart after an improper shutdown.\n    Go to the Volume tab.\n For each of the three folders created earlier, click Add Folder, select the folder, and enter the Mount Path.\n    Go to the Port Settings tab.\n Change the Local Port to match the Container Port value, which in this case is 4873.\n    Click Apply, then Next, and finally Apply.\n   Run Verdaccio  The container should automatically start after applying settings. You can Start, Stop, and Restart it from the Container tab in Docker.\nVerdaccio has a web user interface to display packages in the registry.\nThe web interface can be accessed at http://\u0026lt;nas_ip_address\u0026gt;:4873/.\nVerdaccio has a web user interface to display only the private packages and can be customised to your liking.\n— Verdaccio, Web User Interface  Terminal Commands  \nThe npm executable provides command line access to the registry, and it allows you to add users, login, logout, set the target registry, publish packages, and more.\nMany commands accept an option to target the registry, such as:\nnpm adduser --registry http://\u0026lt;nas_ip_address\u0026gt;:4873/\nYou can also set the registry so that it\u0026rsquo;s automatically used when executing future commands.\n// Sets the registry (storing it in \u0026lt;home_folder\u0026gt;/.npmrc) npm set registry=http://\u0026lt;nas_ip_address\u0026gt;:4873/ // You can now add a user to the registry with out specifying it. npm adduser // Get the current registry npm get registry \u0026gt; http://\u0026lt;nas_ip_address\u0026gt;:4873/ Some Useful Commands  ping Ping npm registry login Create or verify a user account. publish Publish a package whoami Display the username that\u0026rsquo;s currently logged in. help Get help on npm. This will open a webpage with details on the selected command.   Authentication  The basic Verdaccio setup uses htpasswd for authentication.\nThe authentication is tied to the auth plugin you are using. The package restrictions are also handled by the Package Access.\n— Verdaccio, Authentication Based on config.yaml the file should probably be called htpasswd and not the more common .htpasswd.\nYou can use a Linux command line program create an htpasswd file, otherwise try this:\n  Generate a username:password-hash string using an online htpasswd generator. Only the \u0026ldquo;Apache specific salted MD5 (insecure by common)\u0026rdquo; mode worked for me. Your mileage may vary. It should look similar to this:\nusername:$apr1$wzmb709f$fqeK6wasto.rEa6RhtaMj0\n  Create a htpasswd file inside the verdaccio/storage/ folder.\n  In that file paste the generated htpasswd string, then save the file.\n  You should now be able to log in to your registry from the command line using npm login.\n  Authentication Plugins There are more than a dozen other authentication plugins offered by the Verdaccio community, and some of them look pretty cool.\nIn the near future, I intend to try the Verdaccio GitHub OAuth plugin, which offers GitHub OAuth integration for both the browser and the command line. Login can be limited to members of a certain GitHub organizations, and package access can be limited to GitHub organizations, teams, repos, and users. If I switch over to it, I\u0026rsquo;ll update this post with details.\n Publishing Errors  If, when publishing a package in the registry, you receive an error, such as \u0026ldquo;404 Not Found\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;no such package available\u0026rdquo;, the problem could be related to folder ownership.\nBy default, the conf, plugins, and storage folders are owned by the NAS user that created them, however from what I\u0026rsquo;ve read in some bug reports (#483, #1085), the storage folder and possibly all three should have the owner set to verdaccio or, more importantly, to the UID of 10001.\nI received these errors myself, and changing the owner seemed to solve the problem.\nNow changing the owner of a folder or file to another registered user in Synology DSM is pretty straight forward, but changing it to an unknown user or specific UID is not. For that, I believe you need to SSH into the NAS and change it manually from the command line. That\u0026rsquo;s what I did.\nSSH If you\u0026rsquo;re like me, you probably don\u0026rsquo;t have SSH enabled under normal circumstances, so you\u0026rsquo;ll have to temporarily enable it until the folder ownership has changed.\nTo log into the DSM via SSH:\n  Enable SSH via DSM Control Panel \u0026gt; Terminal \u0026amp; SNMP \u0026gt; Enable SSH service.\n  From the Windows Terminal command line:\nssh \u0026lt;admin_account\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;ip_address\u0026gt;\nSo, if the admin user is \u0026ldquo;bob\u0026rdquo; and the NAS IP address is \u0026ldquo;192.168.1.150\u0026rdquo;, you\u0026rsquo;d use:\nssh bob@192.168.1.150\nPrior to DSM 6, you could SSH into the NAS using root along with the admin account password, but that\u0026rsquo;s no longer possible. Instead, you can use any account that\u0026rsquo;s in the admin group, and then use sudo to make super user changes.   Enter the account\u0026rsquo;s password when prompted.\n  You\u0026rsquo;ll likely start in the user\u0026rsquo;s home folder, so change to the verdaccio folder created earlier with something like:\ncd /volume1/docker/verdaccio/\n  You can view the folder owners using ls -l. The third column will list the folder owner.\n  Change the owner of each folder using sudo and chown.\nsudo chown 10001 storage/ sudo chown 10001 plugins/ sudo chown 10001 conf/   Verify that folder ownership has changed then then logout with exit.\n  Disable SSH again via DSM Control Panel \u0026gt; Terminal \u0026amp; SNMP \u0026gt; Enable SSH service.\n   Unity Scoped Registry Setup  \nThe Unity manual covers Scoped Registries and Scoped Registry Authentication, and many other sites provide similar information on how to configure a Unity project to connect to a scoped registry.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll elaborate on the process later, if necessary.\n ","description":"","id":2,"section":"posts","tags":["Synology","Verdaccio","Docker","Unity","npm"],"title":"Verdaccio, Synology, and Unity.

Skip down to the end for a quick little Hugo shortcode for inserting indents in markdown.\nThe Problem Earlier today, I wanted to indent a markdown page element that included a link, but for some reason, the HTML that wrapped the markdown link was breaking the things.\nSearch the web for how to \u0026ldquo;indent without adding a bullet or number in markdown\u0026rdquo; and you\u0026rsquo;ll likely come across multiple suggestions that rely on a mix of HTML tags and CSS styles.\nMost suggestions either involve wrapping the target line with a div styled with a margin to create the indent or a ul and li pair styled to hide the bullet. These suggestions usually work when indenting plain text, but for some reason, they were breaking the link.\nFor example:\n1  \u0026lt;div style=\u0026#34;margin-left: 2em;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;A: [Link](http://example.com)\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;   and\n1  \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li style=\u0026#34;list-style-type: none;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;B: [Link](http://example.com)\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;   Both of the above examples produced a malformed link when the site was built. As shown here, the markdown link was interpreted as plain text.\nA: [Link](http://example.com) B: [Link](http://example.com) \nThe issue can be avoided by inserting a blank line between the opening tags and the link markdown, but it\u0026rsquo;s not pretty.\n1 2 3  \u0026lt;div style=\u0026#34;margin-left: 2em;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; A: [Link](http://example.com)\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;   and\n1 2 3  \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li style=\u0026#34;list-style-type: none;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; B: [Link](http://example.com)\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;   That worked:\nA: Link\nB: Link\nSome people may not care too much about their site\u0026rsquo;s generated HTML, but if you do, you may find this solution is even less ideal once you view the source in a browser. That blank line not only introduces a new paragraph, but the p is opened after the div/li and isn\u0026rsquo;t closed until after the div/ul are closed.\n1 2 3 4 5  \u0026lt;div style=\u0026#34;margin-left: 2em;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A: \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;http://example.com\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Link\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li style=\u0026#34;list-style-type: none;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;B: \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;http://example.com\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Link\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;    While browsers are pretty forgiving and try to understand what\u0026rsquo;s intended, opening and closing HTML tags should be handled like a Last In, First Out (LIFO) stack. Whichever tag you open last should be closed first.\n  Stack Good: \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;i\u0026gt;Last In, First Out (LIFO)\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\n  Queue Bad: \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;i\u0026gt;First In, First Out (FIFO)\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\n\nThe Solution In this case, a better indent solution is to use a simple span styled as an inline-block with an appropriate left margin.\nWrapping the markdown link with the span works fine:\n1  \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;display:inline-block; margin-left: 2em;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;C: [Link](http://example.com)\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;   Closing the span before the markdown is even cleaner:\n1  \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;display:inline-block; margin-left: 2em;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;D: [Link](http://example.com)   C: Link\nD: Link\n\nThe Shortcode To avoid having to insert custom individually styled spans everytime I want to indent something, I created a shortcode to simply things.\n \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;\n layouts\n shortcodes\n indent.html\n1 2 3 4 5  {{- if isset .Params 0 -}} \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;display:inline-block; width:{{ .Get 0 }};\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {{- else -}} \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;display:inline-block; width:2em;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {{- end -}}   The argument after indent is optional. It will default to 2em.

One of my favorites was River Raid, with its endless gameplay provided by procedural terrain generation and enemy placement.\nThe Atari was great, but everything changed for me when I received a Commodore 64 for Christmas in 1982. Compared to the Atari, it had superior graphics and sound, an integrated keyboard, and an amazing 64K of RAM. 64K! More importantly, within minutes of plugging the computer in, I was writing my first program in CBM BASIC. From that point on, I was hooked. Not only did I want to play video games, but I wanted to create \u0026rsquo;em.\nA little more than a decade later, I found myself smack-dab in the middle of the game industry when I joined the legendary Looking Glass Studios as a junior game designer. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve worked at several game studios, filled many development roles, released more than a dozen games on various platforms, and learned a ton along the way.

Extended Syntax These elements extend the basic syntax by adding additional features. Not all Markdown applications support these elements.\nTable A table consists of one or more columns and rows, as well as a required header row.\nUse pipes (|) to separate columns and three or more hyphens (---) to separate the header row from all other rows. For compatibility, a pipe should also be used at the beginning and end of each row.\n    Column 1 Header Column 2 Header     Column 1 Row 1 Column 2 Row 1   Column 1 Row 2 Column 2 Row 2      1 2 3 4  | Column 1 Header | Column 2 Header | | --------------- | --------------- | | Column 1 Row 1 | Column 2 Row 1 | | Column 1 Row 2 | Column 2 Row 2 |   Nested in a Blockquote Custom CSS on this site allows table markdown to be used inside a blockquote by wrapping the markup with a div.table-wrapper.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7  \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;table-wrapper\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026gt; | Column 1 Header | Column 2 Header | \u0026gt; | --------------- | --------------- | \u0026gt; | Column 1 Row 1 | Column 2 Row 1 | \u0026gt; | Column 1 Row 2 | Column 2 Row 2 | \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;   Hiding Header Rows While table header rows are required, they may also be hidden by wrapping the markdown with a div.table-wrapper.no-header.\n    Column 1 Header Column 2 Header     Column 1 Row 1 Column 2 Row 1   Column 1 Row 2 Column 2 Row 2         Column 1 Header Column 2 Header     Column 1 Row 1 Column 2 Row 1   Column 1 Row 2 Column 2 Row 2     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;table-wrapper no-header\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026gt; | Column 1 Header | Column 2 Header | \u0026gt; | --------------- | --------------- | \u0026gt; | Column 1 Row 1 | Column 2 Row 1 | \u0026gt; | Column 1 Row 2 | Column 2 Row 2 | \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;table-wrapper no-header\u0026#34;\u0026gt; | Column 1 Header | Column 2 Header | | --------------- | --------------- | | Column 1 Row 1 | Column 2 Row 1 | | Column 1 Row 2 | Column 2 Row 2 | \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;   Aligning Cell Data Header and cell data can be aligned to the left, right, or center of a the column by inserting colons between hyphens and pipes on the header separator line.\n |:--- | Left align with the colon prefix | ---:| Right align with the colon suffix |:---:| Center the data with prefix and suffix colon.

Simply indent the lines following the definition to include them.\nFootnotes are enumerated in the order they are referenced, so the definition order does not matter. Footnotes that are defined, but not referenced are ignored.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  [^first]: This is the first defined footnote. [^second]: This is the second defined footnote.
