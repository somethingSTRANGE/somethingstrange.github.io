YEAH!","id":1,"section":"posts","tags":["Photoshop","js"],"title":"Photoshop Scripting","uri":"http://somethingstrange.com/posts/photoshop-scripting/"},{"content":"Indenting markdown usually isn\u0026rsquo;t difficult, however there could be a few gotchas. Skip down to the end for a quick little Hugo shortcode for inserting indents in markdown.\nThe Problem Earlier today, I wanted to indent a markdown page element that included a link, but for some reason, the HTML that wrapped the markdown link was breaking the things.\nSearch the web for how to \u0026ldquo;indent without adding a bullet or number in markdown\u0026rdquo; and you\u0026rsquo;ll likely come across multiple suggestions that rely on a mix of HTML tags and CSS styles.\nMost suggestions either involve wrapping the target line with a div styled with a margin to create the indent or a ul and li pair styled to hide the bullet. These suggestions usually work when indenting plain text, but for some reason, they were breaking the link.\nFor example:\n1  \u0026lt;div style=\u0026#34;margin-left: 2em;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;A: [Link](http://example.com)\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;   and\n1  \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li style=\u0026#34;list-style-type: none;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;B: [Link](http://example.com)\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;   Both of the above examples produced a malformed link when the site was built. As shown here, the markdown link was interpreted as plain text.\nA: [Link](http://example.com) B: [Link](http://example.com) \nThe issue can be avoided by inserting a blank line between the opening tags and the link markdown, but it\u0026rsquo;s not pretty.\n1 2 3  \u0026lt;div style=\u0026#34;margin-left: 2em;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; A: [Link](http://example.com)\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;   and\n1 2 3  \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li style=\u0026#34;list-style-type: none;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; B: [Link](http://example.com)\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;   That worked:\nA: Link\nB: Link\nSome people may not care too much about their site\u0026rsquo;s generated HTML, but if you do, you may find this solution is even less ideal once you view the source in a browser. That blank line not only introduces a new paragraph, but the p is opened after the div/li and isn\u0026rsquo;t closed until after the div/ul are closed.\n1 2 3 4 5  \u0026lt;div style=\u0026#34;margin-left: 2em;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A: \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;http://example.com\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Link\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li style=\u0026#34;list-style-type: none;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;B: \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;http://example.com\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Link\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;    While browsers are pretty forgiving and try to understand what\u0026rsquo;s intended, opening and closing HTML tags should be handled like a Last In, First Out (LIFO) stack. Whichever tag you open last should be closed first.\n Stack Good: \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;i\u0026gt;Last In, First Out (LIFO)\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\n Queue Bad: \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;i\u0026gt;First In, First Out (FIFO)\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\n\nThe Solution In this case, a better indent solution is to use a simple span styled as an inline-block with an appropriate left margin.\nWrapping the markdown link with the span works fine:\n1  \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;display:inline-block; margin-left: 2em;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;C: [Link](http://example.com)\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;   Closing the span before the markdown is even cleaner:\n1  \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;display:inline-block; margin-left: 2em;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;D: [Link](http://example.com)   C: Link\nD: Link\n\nThe Shortcode To avoid having to insert custom individually styled spans everytime I want to indent something, I created a shortcode to simply things.\n\u0026lt;root\u0026gt;\nlayouts\nshortcodes\nindent.html\n1 2 3 4 5  {{- if isset .Params 0 -}} \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;display:inline-block; width:{{ .Get 0 }};\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {{- else -}} \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;display:inline-block; width:2em;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {{- end -}}   The argument after indent is optional. It will default to 2em.

One of my favorites was River Raid, with its endless gameplay provided by procedural terrain generation and enemy placement.\nThe Atari was great, but everything changed for me when I received a Commodore 64 for Christmas in 1982. Compared to the Atari, it had superior graphics and sound, an integrated keyboard, and an amazing 64K of RAM. 64K! More importantly, within minutes of plugging the computer in, I was writing my first program in CBM BASIC. From that point on, I was hooked. Not only did I want to play video games, but I wanted to create \u0026lsquo;em.\nA little more than a decade later, I found myself smack-dab in the middle of the game industry when I joined the legendary Looking Glass Studios as a junior game designer. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve worked at several game studios, filled many development roles, released more than a dozen games on various platforms, and learned a ton along the way. Some of the games I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on include Thief: The Dark Project, System Shock 2, Eye of Rana, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, The Bourne Conspiracy, Skylanders: Lost Islands, and Luna and the Moonling.\n     --  When I\u0026rsquo;m not hunched over my workstation in a dimly lit room, I enjoy collecting retro consoles, computers, and games from the late 1970s, 80s, and early 90s.\nMy name is Michael Ryan, and I\u0026rsquo;m a professional game developer and retro computing fanatic.\nLong live the C64!\nREADY.\nÛ ","description":"About page","id":3,"section":"","tags":null,"title":"Greetings, Programs!","uri":"http://somethingstrange.com/about/"},{"content":"Markdown goes here.\nMarkdown goes here.\nTEST\nEN\nAdded \u0026ldquo;meta_image\u0026rdquo; front matter.\nAdded \u0026ldquo;image\u0026rdquo; front matter.\n","description":"","id":9,"section":"showcase","tags":null,"title":"MX vs. ATV Alive","uri":"http://somethingstrange.com/showcase/games/mx-vs-atv-alive/"},{"content":"Markdown goes here.\nMarkdown goes here.\nTEST\nEN\nAdded \u0026ldquo;meta_image\u0026rdquo; front matter.\nAdded \u0026ldquo;image\u0026rdquo; front matter.\n","description":"","id":14,"section":"showcase","tags":null,"title":"Thief 2: The Metal Age","uri":"http://somethingstrange.com/showcase/games/thief-2/"},{"content":"Markdown goes here.\nMarkdown goes here.\nTEST\nEN\nAdded \u0026ldquo;meta_image\u0026rdquo; front matter.\nAdded \u0026ldquo;image\u0026rdquo; front matter.\n","description":"","id":15,"section":"showcase","tags":null,"title":"Thief Gold","uri":"http://somethingstrange.com/showcase/games/thief-gold/"},{"content":"Markdown goes here.\nMarkdown goes here.\nTEST\nEN\nAdded \u0026ldquo;meta_image\u0026rdquo; front matter.\nAdded \u0026ldquo;image\u0026rdquo; front matter.\n","description":"","id":16,"section":"showcase","tags":null,"title":"Thief: The Dark Project","uri":"http://somethingstrange.com/showcase/games/thief/"},{"content":"Gathered from various sources, including The Markdown Guide, GitHub, and others.\nPersonal reference and for testing this site\u0026rsquo;s theme to ensure markdown is rendered correctly.\nThis Markdown cheat sheet provides a quick overview of all the Markdown syntax elements.
