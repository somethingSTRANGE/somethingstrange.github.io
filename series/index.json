[{"content":"Earlier today, I saw a post on Hugo\u0026rsquo;s Discourse site where someone was asking for a way to sort version numbers with a natural sort order where multi-digit numbers are treated atomically.\nThe accepted solution seemed somewhat complicated with the way the versions were split into separate version components (i.e., Major, Minor, Patch, PreRelease), sorted into nested maps, and then merged together again afterward.\nI believe the solution I came up with is a bit more straightforward, and it should be able to sort all SemVer strings. Also, since it doesn\u0026rsquo;t assume the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format, it can also handle version strings with pre-release suffixes, such as \u0026ldquo;beta\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;rc\u0026rdquo;.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 {{- $versions := slice \u0026#34;17.9.200\u0026#34; \u0026#34;17.1.52\u0026#34; \u0026#34;16.8.100\u0026#34; \u0026#34;3.2.3\u0026#34; \u0026#34;3.1.2\u0026#34; \u0026#34;3.10.0\u0026#34; \u0026#34;17.8.20\u0026#34; \u0026#34;3.9.10\u0026#34; \u0026#34;16.8.93\u0026#34; \u0026#34;16.8.201\u0026#34; \u0026#34;17.8.10\u0026#34; \u0026#34;16.8.25-rc.0\u0026#34; \u0026#34;2.8.2\u0026#34; \u0026#34;16.8.21\u0026#34; \u0026#34;16.8.25-rc.2\u0026#34; \u0026#34;16.8.2\u0026#34; \u0026#34;17.21.46\u0026#34; \u0026#34;17.11.42\u0026#34; \u0026#34;20.8.2\u0026#34; \u0026#34;17.9.26\u0026#34; }} {{- $padded := apply $versions \u0026#34;partial\u0026#34; \u0026#34;padZeroPrefix\u0026#34; \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; }} {{- $sorted := sort $padded \u0026#34;value\u0026#34; \u0026#34;desc\u0026#34; }} {{- $results := apply $sorted \u0026#34;partial\u0026#34; \u0026#34;trimZeroPrefix\u0026#34; \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; }} {{- range $results }} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;{{- . }}\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{- end }} The original slice has the padZeroPrefix partial function applied over it, which pads all numbers in the string with zeros to the max length of six digits (the max length can be adjusted in the partial).

It\u0026rsquo;s used all over the place. I use it when developing editor tools for my Unity projects. I love it. It\u0026rsquo;s awesome.\nI just started working on this site and I chose to build it with Hugo, which is a very popular open-source static site generator. So far, I like it a lot, but I was keenly interested in adding support for Font Awesome.\nThe Font Awesome docs provide numerous ways to get started, from kits to self-hosted setups, and using web fonts or SVG images with javascript. There are many, many articles that detail the advantages of SVG icons over font icons, so I\u0026rsquo;m only interested in utilizing SVGs.\nThe traditional setup involves loading in a JavaScript files on every page that will includes icons, and then using placeholder tags wherever you want icons to appear. JavaScript will replace those tags with SVGs once everything finishes loading.\nA 2018 article by Nick Glabreath mentions some potential downsides to the traditional setup, such as extra network dependencies and potential processing delays. It also provides some great information on embedding SVGs directly in the page when the site is built, which avoids the extra network calls and delays at the expense of a slightly larger page load.\nA more recent article by Micah R Ledbetter took what Galbreath presented and made a few enhancements, which I will build upon further.\nQuick and Easy Download Font Awesome I have an active subscription to Font Awesome Pro, so I just downloaded the v5.15.4 release from their website, but you can download the latest release or the free icon set from the GitHub repository. The version I\u0026rsquo;m using contains 7,864 pro icons and 1,608 free icons.\nCopy the SVGs Some of the other articles have you place the SVG (scalable vector graphics) files inside your theme folder, however Hugo is designed for customization with a layer-like site generation workflow. This allows you to modify your site and override your theme without actually changing the theme code or folder structure. Here\u0026rsquo;s a short post illustrating how Hugo Theme Layering works. Ideally nothing should be changed inside the theme folder, and that includes adding your Font Awesome SVGs. So they\u0026rsquo;ll be added to the root instead.\nThe SVGs were extracted from the archive and placed in the assets folder, since they\u0026rsquo;re used like other assets and only accessed when the site is built. The hierarchy looks like this:\n\u0026lt;root\u0026gt; assets svg brands duotone light regular solid If you\u0026rsquo;re using the free version of Font Awesome, you may only have a few of those folders, such as solid and brands.\nAdd the partials Processing the SVG Create a partial file: \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;/layouts/partials/fontawesome.html\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 {{- $settings := partial \u0026#34;func/getFontAwesomeSettings.html\u0026#34; (dict \u0026#34;style\u0026#34; .style \u0026#34;arg1\u0026#34; .arg1 \u0026#34;arg2\u0026#34; .arg2) -}} \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;line-height:1em; vertical-align:middle;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {{- $fname:=print \u0026#34;/assets/svg/\u0026#34; .style \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; .icon \u0026#34;.svg\u0026#34; -}} {{- if (fileExists $fname) -}} {{- $svg := readFile $fname -}} {{- $svg = replace $svg \u0026#34; 512\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--\u0026#34; (print \u0026#34; 512\\\u0026#34; style=\\\u0026#34;height:\u0026#34; $settings.size \u0026#34;; width:\u0026#34; $settings.size \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--\u0026#34;) -}} {{- $svg = replaceRE \u0026#34;\u0026lt;!--[^\u0026gt;]*--\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \u0026#34;\u0026#34; $svg -}} {{- if eq .style \u0026#34;duotone\u0026#34; -}} {{- $svg = replace $svg \u0026#34;class=\\\u0026#34;fa-primary\\\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;\u0026#34; (print \u0026#34;class=\\\u0026#34;fa-primary\\\u0026#34; style=\\\u0026#34;fill:\u0026#34; $settings.primaryColor \u0026#34;; opacity:\u0026#34; $settings.primaryOpacity \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) -}} {{- $svg = replace $svg \u0026#34;class=\\\u0026#34;fa-secondary\\\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;\u0026#34; (print \u0026#34;class=\\\u0026#34;fa-secondary\\\u0026#34; style=\\\u0026#34;fill:\u0026#34; $settings.secondaryColor \u0026#34;; opacity:\u0026#34; $settings.secondaryOpacity \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;\u0026#34;) -}} {{- $svg = replace $svg \u0026#34;\u0026lt;defs\u0026gt;\u0026lt;style\u0026gt;.fa-secondary{opacity:.4}\u0026lt;/style\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/defs\u0026gt;\u0026#34; \u0026#34;\u0026#34; -}} {{- else -}} {{- $svg = replace $svg \u0026#34;\u0026lt;path\u0026#34; (print \u0026#34;\u0026lt;path fill=\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34; $settings.primaryColor \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34; opacity=\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34; $settings.primaryOpacity \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) -}} {{- end -}} {{- $svg | safeHTML -}} {{- else -}} \u0026lt;span class=\u0026#34;sc-fontawesome-missing\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Could not find \u0026amp;quot;{{.icon}}\u0026amp;quot; icon with \u0026amp;quot;{{.style}}\u0026amp;quot; style\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;#xFFFD;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {{- warnf \u0026#34;Could not find \\\u0026#34;%s\\\u0026#34; icon with \\\u0026#34;%s\\\u0026#34; style.\u0026#34; .icon .style -}} {{- end -}} \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{{- \u0026#34;\u0026#34; -}} Note that this partial differs from Ledbetter\u0026rsquo;s in a few ways.\nThis partial was placed outside the theme, so the theme folder path is no longer needed in the $fname variable. The icon style and name are passed to the partial separately and accessed using .style and .icon, respectively. Optional size and color (with opacity) settings may now be passed through the shortcodes, and the input is validated with a call to the getFontAwesomeSettings partial, which returns values that are accessed with $settings. The size is applied directly to \u0026lt;svg\u0026gt; using inline styles, which seems to improve layout and sizing with adjacent text. There\u0026rsquo;s now special handling of duotone icons, which have primary and secondary colors and opacities, and those need to be applied to the appropriate \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; in the SVG. The \u0026lt;defs\u0026gt;\u0026lt;style\u0026gt; combo is also removed, as its no longer needed. There\u0026rsquo;s a check to see if the file exists before rendering it. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, a build warning will be logged and the replacement glyph (�) will be embedded into the page instead. The span wrapping the replacement character also has a tooltip that includes the icon and style names being used, which may be useful for debugging the missing icon. Most importantly, this check allows Hugo to successfully rebuild the page, otherwise the build will fail when readFile fails to load the missing SVG file. Parsing Settings Create a partial file: \u0026lt;root\u0026gt;/layouts/partials/func/getFontAwesomeSettings.html\nNote that I placed this in the func sub-directory, because this partial will return a value, and I like to keep partials that return values separate from those that don\u0026rsquo;t.\nA partial that returns a value may only return a value and cannot affect rendering output, so there\u0026rsquo;s no need to worry about whitespace sneaking into the generated HTML when the site is built. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 {{ $lengthPattern := \u0026#34;^[\\\\d\\\\.]+(?i)(?:cm|in|mm|pc|pt|px|q|%|ch|em|ex|lh|rem|vh|vmax|vmin|vw)(?-i)$\u0026#34; }} {{ $data := newScratch }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;size\u0026#34; \u0026#34;1em\u0026#34; }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;primaryColor\u0026#34; \u0026#34;currentColor\u0026#34; }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;primaryOpacity\u0026#34; \u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;secondaryColor\u0026#34; \u0026#34;currentColor\u0026#34; }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;secondaryOpacity\u0026#34; \u0026#34;0.4\u0026#34; }} {{ $args := slice .arg1 .arg2 }} {{ range $args }} {{ $length := findRE $lengthPattern . }} {{ with $length }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;size\u0026#34; (delimit $length \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) }} {{ else }} {{ with . }} {{ $parts := split . \u0026#34;;\u0026#34; }} {{ with (index $parts 0) }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;primaryColor\u0026#34; ((partial \u0026#34;func/getFontAwesomeColorOpacity.html\u0026#34; (slice . 0)) | default \u0026#34;currentColor\u0026#34;) -}}) }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;primaryOpacity\u0026#34; ((partial \u0026#34;func/getFontAwesomeColorOpacity.html\u0026#34; (slice . 1)) | default \u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;) -}}) }} {{ end }} {{ with (index $parts 1) }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;secondaryColor\u0026#34; ((partial \u0026#34;func/getFontAwesomeColorOpacity.html\u0026#34; (slice . 0)) | default \u0026#34;currentColor\u0026#34;) -}}) }} {{ $data.Set \u0026#34;secondaryOpacity\u0026#34; ((partial \u0026#34;func/getFontAwesomeColorOpacity.html\u0026#34; (slice . 1)) | default \u0026#34;0.4\u0026#34;) -}}) }} {{ end }} {{ end }} {{ end }} {{ end }} {{- return (dict \u0026#34;size\u0026#34; ($data.Get \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;) \u0026#34;primaryColor\u0026#34; ($data.Get \u0026#34;primaryColor\u0026#34;) \u0026#34;primaryOpacity\u0026#34; ($data.Get \u0026#34;primaryOpacity\u0026#34;) \u0026#34;secondaryColor\u0026#34; ($data.Get \u0026#34;secondaryColor\u0026#34;) \u0026#34;secondaryOpacity\u0026#34; ($data.Get \u0026#34;secondaryOpacity\u0026#34;) ) -}} This may look a bit complicated, but that\u0026rsquo;s because either or both of the size and color/opacity settings can be provided and in any order, which simplifies the shortcode usage and makes it more flexible. Also, the color data is a compound string containing up to two color and two opacity values, which are parsed and separated before the values are returned.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll run through it quickly.\nA regex pattern is used to identify the size argument, and all length types defined in the CSS specification are included. I only tested with em, rem, and px, but they should all work as expected. A scratch is used to store potential results as the partial arguments are being processed. Default values are established and will be used unless the setting is overridden by an argument. Both arguments are examined, and if the size is identified, it\u0026rsquo;s used, otherwise color parsing is performed. Parsing calls the getFontAwesomeColorOpacity partial, which takes a slice and returns a string, and if parsing fails a default value will be applied. The results are returned in a dict using named parameters.

Unfortunately, most of those resources focus on setting up Verdaccio on a local system, and when docker is involved the tutorials usually assume docker is being run from the command line.\nRunning docker containers on a Synology NAS is a completely different process, and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to find even a single resource that covered the procedure. This post will hopefully clear some things up.\nDocker First things first, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to install the Docker package if it\u0026rsquo;s not already installed.\nDocker is a lightweight virtualization application that gives you the ability to run thousands of containers created by developers from all over the world on DSM. The hugely popular built-in image repository, Docker Hub, allows you to find shared applications from other talented developers.\n— Synology DSM Feature: Docker Open Synology Package Center.\nSearch for docker, select it, and click Install.\nFor more in-depth information, see How to use Docker on a Synology NAS.\nFolder Setup When working with Docker containers, I try to handle them like read-only objects whenever possible. If the container needs to work with persistent data, that data should be stored outside the container.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s common for containers to provide \u0026ldquo;mount paths\u0026rdquo; that can be used to map file system folders to the container. The container will then store data in those mapped folders. Later, if you decide to update or replace the container, the persistent data will remain in these folders.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t store data in containers - A container can be stopped, destroyed, or replaced. An application version 1.0 running in container should be easily replaced by the version 1.1 without any impact or loss of data. For that reason, if you need to store data, do it in a volume. In this case, you should also take care if two containers write data on the same volume as it could cause corruption. Make sure your applications are designed to write to a shared data store.\n— 10 things to avoid in docker containers, #1 Tip The Verdaccio container exposes three mount paths (conf, plugins, and storage), and we\u0026rsquo;re going to set those folders up first, so that they\u0026rsquo;re ready to use when Verdaccio is configured later.\nCreate a Shared Folder called docker. It\u0026rsquo;s assumed you\u0026rsquo;ve already created shared folders on your NAS and know how it\u0026rsquo;s done.\nConsider using the following configuration options:\nDisable: Advanced Permissions, Recycle Bin, and File Compression. Enable: Data Integrity Protection. Using File Station, create the following folder hierarchy, which will be used by the container:\ndocker verdaccio conf plugins storage Download Verdaccio Download the latest 5.x container, which as of 2022-03-01 is 5.6.2.\nVersion 6 (Development branch)\n— GitHub / Verdaccio Open Docker and go to the Registry tab.\nSearch for verdaccio/verdaccio, select it, and click Download.\nSelect 5 from the Please Choose a Tag dropdown and click Select.\nInstall Verdaccio In Docker, go to the Image tab.\nLaunch verdaccio/verdaccio:5 image with the following settings:\nChange the Container Name name, as desired. The default name is verdaccio-verdaccio. Check Enable resource limitation, if you want to control how much memory the container will use. My NAS has 8 GB of RAM, so I set the Memory Limit to 2048 MB.\nClick Advanced Settings and go to the Advanced Settings tab, if it\u0026rsquo;s not already selected.\nCheck Enable auto-restart so that the container will restart after an improper shutdown.\nGo to the Volume tab.\nFor each of the three folders created earlier, click Add Folder, select the folder, and enter the Mount Path.\nGo to the Port Settings tab.\nChange the Local Port to match the Container Port value, which in this case is 4873.\nClick Apply, then Next, and finally Apply.\nRun Verdaccio The container should automatically start after applying settings. You can Start, Stop, and Restart it from the Container tab in Docker.\nVerdaccio has a web user interface to display packages in the registry.\nThe web interface can be accessed at http://\u0026lt;nas_ip_address\u0026gt;:4873/.\nVerdaccio has a web user interface to display only the private packages and can be customised to your liking.\n— Verdaccio, Web User Interface Terminal Commands The npm executable provides command line access to the registry, and it allows you to add users, login, logout, set the target registry, publish packages, and more.\nMany commands accept an option to target the registry, such as:\nnpm adduser --registry http://\u0026lt;nas_ip_address\u0026gt;:4873/\nYou can also set the registry so that it\u0026rsquo;s automatically used when executing future commands.\n// Sets the registry (storing it in \u0026lt;home_folder\u0026gt;/.npmrc) npm set registry=http://\u0026lt;nas_ip_address\u0026gt;:4873/ // You can now add a user to the registry with out specifying it. npm adduser // Get the current registry npm get registry \u0026gt; http://\u0026lt;nas_ip_address\u0026gt;:4873/ Some Useful Commands ping Ping npm registry login Create or verify a user account. publish Publish a package whoami Display the username that\u0026rsquo;s currently logged in. help Get help on npm. This will open a webpage with details on the selected command. Authentication The basic Verdaccio setup uses htpasswd for authentication.\nThe authentication is tied to the auth plugin you are using. The package restrictions are also handled by the Package Access.\n— Verdaccio, Authentication Based on config.yaml the file should probably be called htpasswd and not the more common .htpasswd.\nYou can use a Linux command line program create an htpasswd file, otherwise try this:\nGenerate a username:password-hash string using an online htpasswd generator. Only the \u0026ldquo;Apache specific salted MD5 (insecure by common)\u0026rdquo; mode worked for me. Your mileage may vary. It should look similar to this:\nusername:$apr1$wzmb709f$fqeK6wasto.rEa6RhtaMj0\nCreate a htpasswd file inside the verdaccio/storage/ folder.\nIn that file paste the generated htpasswd string, then save the file.\nYou should now be able to log in to your registry from the command line using npm login.\nAuthentication Plugins There are more than a dozen other authentication plugins offered by the Verdaccio community, and some of them look pretty cool.\nIn the near future, I intend to try the Verdaccio GitHub OAuth plugin, which offers GitHub OAuth integration for both the browser and the command line. Login can be limited to members of a certain GitHub organizations, and package access can be limited to GitHub organizations, teams, repos, and users. If I switch over to it, I\u0026rsquo;ll update this post with details.\nPublishing Errors If, when publishing a package in the registry, you receive an error, such as \u0026ldquo;404 Not Found\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;no such package available\u0026rdquo;, the problem could be related to folder ownership.\nBy default, the conf, plugins, and storage folders are owned by the NAS user that created them, however from what I\u0026rsquo;ve read in some bug reports (#483, #1085), the storage folder and possibly all three should have the owner set to verdaccio or, more importantly, to the UID of 10001.\nI received these errors myself, and changing the owner seemed to solve the problem.\nNow changing the owner of a folder or file to another registered user in Synology DSM is pretty straight forward, but changing it to an unknown user or specific UID is not. For that, I believe you need to SSH into the NAS and change it manually from the command line. That\u0026rsquo;s what I did.\nSSH If you\u0026rsquo;re like me, you probably don\u0026rsquo;t have SSH enabled under normal circumstances, so you\u0026rsquo;ll have to temporarily enable it until the folder ownership has changed.\nTo log into the DSM via SSH:\nEnable SSH via DSM Control Panel \u0026gt; Terminal \u0026amp; SNMP \u0026gt; Enable SSH service.\nFrom the Windows Terminal command line:\nssh \u0026lt;admin_account\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;ip_address\u0026gt;\nSo, if the admin user is \u0026ldquo;bob\u0026rdquo; and the NAS IP address is \u0026ldquo;192.168.1.150\u0026rdquo;, you\u0026rsquo;d use:\nssh bob@192.168.1.150\nPrior to DSM 6, you could SSH into the NAS using root along with the admin account password, but that\u0026rsquo;s no longer possible. Instead, you can use any account that\u0026rsquo;s in the admin group, and then use sudo to make super user changes. Enter the account\u0026rsquo;s password when prompted.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll likely start in the user\u0026rsquo;s home folder, so change to the verdaccio folder created earlier with something like:\ncd /volume1/docker/verdaccio/\nYou can view the folder owners using ls -l. The third column will list the folder owner.\nChange the owner of each folder using sudo and chown.\nsudo chown 10001 storage/ sudo chown 10001 plugins/ sudo chown 10001 conf/ Verify that folder ownership has changed then then logout with exit.\nDisable SSH again via DSM Control Panel \u0026gt; Terminal \u0026amp; SNMP \u0026gt; Enable SSH service.\nUnity Scoped Registry Setup The Unity manual covers Scoped Registries and Scoped Registry Authentication, and many other sites provide similar information on how to configure a Unity project to connect to a scoped registry.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll elaborate on the process later, if necessary.\n","description":"","id":3,"section":"posts","tags":["Synology","Verdaccio","Docker","Unity","npm"],"title":"Verdaccio, Synology, and Unity.

Information Separators Can be used as delimiters to mark fields of data structures. If used for hierarchical levels, US is the lowest level (dividing plain-text data items), while RS, GS, and FS are of increasing level to divide groups made up of items of the level beneath it.\nWhile it\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy to use JSON, XML, or YAML to serialize data, sometimes less robust solution is okay. For example, you could use : to join a key and value pair and then ; to join multiple pairs together.\nkey1:value1;key2:value2\nThat\u0026rsquo;s simple enough, but what if the key and/or value contains one of those joining characters?

Followed by EOT. In keyboard input, often used as a \u0026lsquo;break\u0026rsquo; character (Ctrl+C) to interrupt or terminate a program or process. ␄ U+0004 EOT :: End of Transmission ^D \u0026ensp;Copy Marks the end of a transmitted message. Often used on Unix to indicate end-of-file on a terminal, interpreted by the shell as the command exit or logout. Other transmission control codes are used for back and forth communication between systems, which may involve establishing or terminating connections, handshaking, and the transmission of data.\nA very basic example of a two-way handshake and data transmission goes something like this: A host will send ENQ to the server and wait for a response. When the server receives the packet, it will respond with ACK if it is ready to receive data or NAK if it\u0026rsquo;s not. Once the host receives the ACK, the handshake will complete, and the host will begin sending data one packet at a time. After each packet is sent, the host will wait for an ACK response before sending the next packet. This back and forth would continue until all data is sent. The host ends the transmission by sending EOT.\nThree-way TCP handshaking uses SYN and ACK for synchronizing communications. A client sends a SYN along with a sequence number (X). The server responds by sending its own SYN and sequence number (Y) along with an ACK and the client\u0026rsquo;s sequence number (X). When the client receives the ACK with the correct sequence (X), it responds by sending its own ACK along with the server\u0026rsquo;s sequence number (Y). The handshake is complete with the client knowing the server and the server knowing the client.\n␅ U+0005 ENQ :: Enquiry ^E \u0026ensp;Copy Signal intended to trigger a response at the receiving end, to see if it is still present. ␆ U+0006 ACK :: Acknowledge ^F \u0026ensp;Copy Response to an ENQ, or an indication of successful receipt of a message. ␐ U+0010 DLE :: Data Link Escape ^P \u0026ensp;Copy Cause a limited number of contiguously following octets to be interpreted in some different way, for example as raw data (as opposed to control codes or graphic characters). The details of this are implementation dependent. ␕ U+0015 NAK :: Negative Acknowledge ^U \u0026ensp;Copy Sent by a station as a negative response to the station with which the connection has been set up. In binary synchronous communication protocol, the NAK is used to indicate that an error was detected in the previously received block and that the receiver is ready to accept retransmission of that block. In multipoint systems, the NAK is used as the not-ready reply to a poll. ␖ U+0016 SYN :: Synchronous Idle ^V \u0026ensp;Copy Used in synchronous transmission systems to provide a signal from which synchronous correction may be achieved between data terminal equipment, particularly when no other character is being transmitted. ␗ U+0017 ETB :: End of Transmission Block ^W \u0026ensp;Copy Indicates the end of a transmission block of data when data are divided into such blocks for transmission purposes. If it is not in use for another purpose, IPTC 7901 recommends interpreting ETB as an end of paragraph character. Device Controls These four control codes are reserved for the control of devices, such as the Telex teleprinter, where DC1 (known also as XON) and DC2 were intended for activating the device, while DC3 (known also as XOFF) and DC4 were intended for pausing and turning off the device.\n␑ U+0011 DC1 :: Device Control 1 (XON) ^Q \u0026ensp;Copy ␒ U+0012 DC2 :: Device Control 2 ^R \u0026ensp;Copy ␓ U+0013 DC3 :: Device Control 3 (XOFF) ^S \u0026ensp;Copy ␔ U+0014 DC4 :: Device Control 4 ^T \u0026ensp;Copy Locking Shifts The SO and SI codes were used to convert between 8-bit and 7-bit character codes. In a 7-bit environment, the Shift Out (SO) control would change the meaning of bytes 0x21 through 0x7E (i.e. the graphical codes, excluding the space) to invoke characters from an alternative set, and the Shift In (SI) control would change them back.\n␎ U+000E SO :: Shift Out ^N \u0026ensp;Copy Switch to an alternative character set. ␏ U+000F SI :: Shift In ^O \u0026ensp;Copy Return to regular character set after Shift Out. Others ␀ U+0000 NUL \\0 ^@ \u0026ensp;Copy Often used as a string terminator, especially in the programming language C. ␇ U+0007 BEL :: Bell, Alert \\a ^G \u0026ensp;Copy Originally used to sound an electromechanical bell on the terminal. Later used for a beep on systems that had no physical bell. On some system terminals, it may instead toggle inverse video. ␘ U+0018 CAN :: Cancel ^X \u0026ensp;Copy Indicates that the data preceding it are in error or are to be disregarded. ␙ U+0019 EM :: End of Medium ^Y \u0026ensp;Copy May be used to indicate the end of the used portion (or usable portion) of the storage medium (i.e., paper or magnetic tapes). Alternatively, it may be repurposed as a space indenting the first line of a paragraph. ␚ U+001A SUB :: Substitute ^Z \u0026ensp;Copy In DOS and Windows, it is used to indicate the end of file, both when typing on the terminal, and sometimes in text files stored on disk. ␛ U+001B ESC :: Escape \\e ^[ \u0026ensp;Copy The Esc key on the keyboard will cause this character to be sent on most systems. In device-control protocols (e.g., printers and terminals) it signals that what follows is a special command sequence rather than normal text. ANSI Escape Codes begin with this escape character.

Skip down to the end for a quick little Hugo shortcode for inserting indents in markdown.\nThe Problem Earlier today, I wanted to indent a markdown page element that included a link, but for some reason, the HTML that wrapped the markdown link was breaking the things.\nSearch the web for how to \u0026ldquo;indent without adding a bullet or number in markdown\u0026rdquo; and you\u0026rsquo;ll likely come across multiple suggestions that rely on a mix of HTML tags and CSS styles.\nMost suggestions either involve wrapping the target line with a div styled with a margin to create the indent or a ul and li pair styled to hide the bullet. These suggestions usually work when indenting plain text, but for some reason, they were breaking the link.\nFor example:\n1 \u0026lt;div style=\u0026#34;margin-left: 2em;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;A: [Link](http://example.com)\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; and\n1 \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li style=\u0026#34;list-style-type: none;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;B: [Link](http://example.com)\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; Both of the above examples produced a malformed link when the site was built. As shown here, the markdown link was interpreted as plain text.\nA: [Link](http://example.com) B: [Link](http://example.com) The issue can be avoided by inserting a blank line between the opening tags and the link markdown, but it\u0026rsquo;s not pretty.\n1 2 3 \u0026lt;div style=\u0026#34;margin-left: 2em;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; A: [Link](http://example.com)\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; and\n1 2 3 \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li style=\u0026#34;list-style-type: none;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; B: [Link](http://example.com)\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; That worked:\nA: Link\nB: Link\nSome people may not care too much about their site\u0026rsquo;s generated HTML, but if you do, you may find this solution is even less ideal once you view the source in a browser. That blank line not only introduces a new paragraph, but the p is opened after the div/li and isn\u0026rsquo;t closed until after the div/ul are closed.\n1 2 3 4 5 \u0026lt;div style=\u0026#34;margin-left: 2em;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A: \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;http://example.com\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Link\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li style=\u0026#34;list-style-type: none;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;B: \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;http://example.com\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Link\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; While browsers are pretty forgiving and try to understand what\u0026rsquo;s intended, opening and closing HTML tags should be handled like a Last In, First Out (LIFO) stack. Whichever tag you open last should be closed first.\nStack Good: \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;i\u0026gt;Last In, First Out (LIFO)\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\nQueue Bad: \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;i\u0026gt;First In, First Out (FIFO)\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\nThe Solution In this case, a better indent solution is to use a simple span styled as an inline-block with an appropriate left margin.\nWrapping the markdown link with the span works fine:\n1 \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;display:inline-block; margin-left: 2em;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;C: [Link](http://example.com)\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; Closing the span before the markdown is even cleaner:\n1 \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;display:inline-block; margin-left: 2em;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;D: [Link](http://example.com) C: Link\nD: Link\nThe Shortcode To avoid having to insert custom individually styled spans everytime I want to indent something, I created a shortcode to simply things.\n\u0026lt;root\u0026gt; layouts shortcodes indent.html 1 2 3 4 5 {{- if isset .Params 0 -}} \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;display:inline-block; width:{{ .Get 0 }};\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {{- else -}} \u0026lt;span style=\u0026#34;display:inline-block; width:2em;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {{- end -}} The argument after indent is optional.

One of my favorites was River Raid, with its endless gameplay provided by procedural terrain generation and enemy placement.\nThe Atari was great, but everything changed for me when I received a Commodore 64 for Christmas in 1982. Compared to the Atari, it had superior graphics and sound, an integrated keyboard, and an amazing 64K of RAM. 64K! More importantly, within minutes of plugging the computer in, I was writing my first program in CBM BASIC. From that point on, I was hooked. Not only did I want to play video games, but I wanted to create \u0026rsquo;em.\nA little more than a decade later, I found myself smack-dab in the middle of the game industry when I joined the legendary Looking Glass Studios as a junior game designer. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve worked at several game studios, filled many development roles, released more than a dozen games on various platforms, and learned a ton along the way. Some of the games I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on include Thief: The Dark Project, System Shock 2, Eye of Rana, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, The Bourne Conspiracy, Skylanders: Lost Islands, and Luna and the Moonling.\nWhen I\u0026rsquo;m not hunched over my workstation in a dimly lit room, I enjoy collecting retro consoles, computers, and games from the late 1970s, 80s, and early 90s.\nMy name is Michael Ryan, and I\u0026rsquo;m a professional game developer and retro computing fanatic.\nLong live the C64!\nREADY.\nÛ ","description":"About page","id":7,"section":"","tags":null,"title":"Greetings, Programs!","uri":"http://somethingstrange.com/about/"},{"content":"Markdown goes here.\nMarkdown goes here.\nTEST\nEN\nAdded \u0026ldquo;meta_image\u0026rdquo; front matter.\nAdded \u0026ldquo;image\u0026rdquo; front matter.\n","description":"","id":13,"section":"showcase","tags":null,"title":"MX vs. ATV Alive","uri":"http://somethingstrange.com/showcase/games/mx-vs-atv-alive/"},{"content":"Markdown goes here.\nMarkdown goes here.\nTEST\nEN\nAdded \u0026ldquo;meta_image\u0026rdquo; front matter.\nAdded \u0026ldquo;image\u0026rdquo; front matter.\n","description":"","id":18,"section":"showcase","tags":null,"title":"Thief 2: The Metal Age","uri":"http://somethingstrange.com/showcase/games/thief-2/"},{"content":"Markdown goes here.\nMarkdown goes here.\nTEST\nEN\nAdded \u0026ldquo;meta_image\u0026rdquo; front matter.\nAdded \u0026ldquo;image\u0026rdquo; front matter.\n","description":"","id":19,"section":"showcase","tags":null,"title":"Thief Gold","uri":"http://somethingstrange.com/showcase/games/thief-gold/"},{"content":"Markdown goes here.\nMarkdown goes here.\nTEST\nEN\nAdded \u0026ldquo;meta_image\u0026rdquo; front matter.\nAdded \u0026ldquo;image\u0026rdquo; front matter.\n","description":"","id":20,"section":"showcase","tags":null,"title":"Thief: The Dark Project","uri":"http://somethingstrange.com/showcase/games/thief/"},{"content":"Gathered from various sources, including The Markdown Guide, GitHub, and others.\nPersonal reference and for testing this site\u0026rsquo;s theme to ensure markdown is rendered correctly.\nThis Markdown cheat sheet provides a quick overview of all the Markdown syntax elements.
