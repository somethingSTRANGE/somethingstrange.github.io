I particularly enjoyed River Raid with its seemingly endless gameplay provided by procedural terrain generation.\nI recieved a Commodore 64 for Christmas in 1982, and it changed everything for me. Compared to the Atari, it had superior graphics and sound, an integrated keyboard, and an amazing 64K of RAM. 64K! More importantly, within minutes of plugging the computer in, I was writing my first program in CBM BASIC. From that point on, I was hooked. Not only did I want to play video games, but I wanted to make my own.\nA little more than a decade later, I found myself smack-dab in the middle of the video game industry when I joined Looking Glass Studios as a junior game designer. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve worked at several game studios, filled many development roles, released a bunch of games on various platforms, and learned a ton along the way. Some of the game I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on include Thief: The Dark Project, System Shock 2, Eye of Rana, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, The Bourne Conspiracy, Skylanders: Lost Islands, and Luna and the Moonling.\n     --  When I\u0026rsquo;m not hunched over my workstation in a dimly lit room, I enjoy collecting retro consoles, computers, and games from the late 1970s, 80s, and early 90s.\nMy name is Michael Ryan, and I\u0026rsquo;m a professional game developer and retro computing fanatic.\nLong Live the Commodore 64!\n","description":"Zzo about page","id":2,"section":"","tags":null,"title":"About","uri":"http://somethingstrange.com/about/"}]
